{"name":"plot2svg","tagline":"Save MATLAB plots as svg files","body":"Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) Export of Figures\r\n\r\nConverts 2D & 3D Matlab plots to the scalable vector format (SVG). This format is specified by W3C (http://www.w3.org) and can be viewed and printed with internet browsers.\r\n\r\nAdded preliminary support of filter, clipping, and tickmark extensions that go beyond the Matlab functionality. SVG filters are a great tool to create stylish plots! Try it out! Before you start using this new features have a look at the tutorial.
